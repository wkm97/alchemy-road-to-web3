# How to build an NFT marketplace from scratch
## Summary
- The focus of this tutorial will be on building the smart contract and not building the frontend.
    - However, the code for frontend is available.
- No backend or database is involved in this tutorial.
    - As you start to archive data and integrate register/login features, a backend + database will be needed.
- Using technologies like Alchemy, IPFS, Hardhat and ethers.

## Exercise
1. Use Alchemy's getNFTs and getNFTsForCollection endpoints to fetch NFTs for the marketplace and profile page
2. Add functionality to let users list pre-existing NFTs to the marketplace
3. Adding Royalties such that the original NFT creator gets 10% of the proceeds every time that NFT gets sold
